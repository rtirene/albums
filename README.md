First app created for "The Complete React Native and Redux" course by Stephen Grider

It consists of a simple scrollable list of music albums, that come with a "Buy Now" button to purchase the item on Amazon.

This was the very first app I've built using React Native and it's been a great way to learn how to organize and manage components.

## ps: I am not a Taylor Swift fan.
